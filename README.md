- 👋 Hi everyone, my name is Yuan Zhaoliang. I am currently a master student major in operations research in Univisity of Southern California. 
- My research interest 💞️  is combinatorial optimization, focus on some local optimization alogoritms and approximation algorithms in TravelSalesman Problem(TSP).
- I will post some problem-specific or general algorithms for TSP in the future. 
- If you are interested in my work or find any problem, maybe you can send me a 📫 to zhaolian@usc.edu.
